# Overwrite

> Vite+Electron = üî•

This template uses [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/) as bundler and [Electron builder](https://www.electron.build/) as compiler.

This is a minimalist template designed for a **simple and flexible start of your project**.


## Important
I work on this template in my free time, and work on it on my own. 

If you have ideas, questions or suggestions - **Welcome to [discussions](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/discussions)**. üòä

## Features

- **Electron**
  - Template use the latest electron version with all the latest security patches.
  - The architecture of the application is built according to the security [guids](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security) and best practices.
  - The latest version of the [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) is used to compile the application.
- **Vite**
  - [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/) is used to package all source codes. This is an extremely fast packer that has a bunch of great features. You can learn more about how it is arranged in [this](https://youtu.be/xXrhg26VCSc) video.
  - Vite [supports](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/#modes-and-environment-variables) reading `.env` files. My template has a separate command to generate `.d.ts` file with type definition your environment variables.
- **TypeScript**
  - The Latest TypeScript is used for all source code. 
  - **Vite** supports TypeScript out of the box. However, it does not support type checking.
  - Type checking is performed in both `.ts` and `.vue` files thanks to [@vuedx/typecheck](https://github.com/znck/vue-developer-experience/tree/master/packages/typecheck).
  - Code formatting rules follow the latest TypeScript recommendations and best practices thanks to [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin).
- **Vue 3**
  - By default, web pages are built using the latest version of the [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next). However, there are no problems with using any other frameworks or technologies.
  - ~~The latest version of the [Vue router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next) is also used~~. See [#6](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/pull/6).
  - Code formatting rules follow the latest Vue recommendations and best practices thanks to [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue).
  - Installed [Vue.js devtools beta](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg) with Vue 3 support.
- **Continuous Integration**
  - The configured workflow for check the types for each push and PR.
  - The configured workflow for check the code style for each push and PR.
  - ‚è≥ **Automatic tests**. I plan to add a simple test that will check if the application is being built, opened, and displays at least some content.  But this test will not test any functionality of the application.
- **Continuous deployment**
  - Each time you push changes to the main branch, a workflow starts, which creates a new github release.
    - The version number is automatically set based on the current date in the format "yy.mm.dd".
    - Notes are automatically generated and added to the new release.
  - Automatic update from GitHub releases is supported.

## Status
- ‚úÖ Building main and renderer endpoints in production mode -- works great.
- ‚úÖ Development mode with hot reload for renderer endpoint -- works great.
- ‚ö† Development mode for main and preload endpoints -- work fine, but it is possible to reboot the backend faster ([vite#972](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/972))
- ‚úÖ Compile the app with electron builder in CD -- work.
- ‚úÖ Auto update -- work.
- ‚úÖ Typechecking in `.ts` and `.vue` files -- work thanks [@vuedx/typecheck](https://github.com/znck/vue-developer-experience/tree/master/packages/typecheck) (üö® Pre Alpha)
- ‚ö† Linting -- work fine, but need review the configuration files and refactor its. It may also intersect somewhat with Typechecking.
- ‚úÖ Vue.js devtools beta.
- ‚è≥ Code signing -- planned. 
- ‚è≥ Refactor and simplify the set of npm scripts -- planned.
- ‚è≥ Refactor and simplify eslint configs -- planned.

## How it works
The template required a minimum [dependencies](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/blob/main/package.json). Only **Vite** is used for building, nothing more.

All additional dependencies for linter or typechecking well be install, if necessary in the CI workflow.

### Modes and Environment Variables
All environment variables set as part of the `import.meta`, so you can access them as follows: `import.meta.env`. 

You can also build type definitions of your variables by running `/bin/buildEnvTypes.js`. This command will create `/types/env.d.ts` file with describing all environment variables for all modes.

The mode option is used to specify the value of `import.meta.env.MODE` and the corresponding environment variables files that needs to be loaded.

By default, there are two modes:
  - `production` is used by `build:*` scripts
  - `development` is used by `watch:build:*` scripts


When running `build:*` or `watch:build:*`, environment variables are loaded from the following files in your project root:

```
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified env mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified env mode, ignored by git
```

**Note:** only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to your code. e.g. `VITE_SOME_KEY=123` will be exposed as `import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY`, but `SOME_KEY=123` will not. This is because the `.env` files may be used by some users for server-side or build scripts and may contain sensitive information that should not be exposed in code shipped to browsers.

### Project Structure
- `/src`
  Contains all source code.
  - `/src/main` 
  Contain entrypoint for Electron [**main script**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file).
  - `/src/renderer` 
    Contain entrypoint for Electron [**web page**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-a-web-page). All files in this directory work as a regular Vue application.
  - `/src/preload` 
    Contain entrypoint for custom script. It uses as `preload` script in `BrowserWindow.webPreferences.preload`. See [Checklist: Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content).
  - `/src/*` It is assumed any entry points will be added here, for custom scripts, web workers, webassembly compilations, etc.
- `/dist` 
  - `/dist/source`
  Contains all bundled code.
    - `/dist/source/main` Bundled *main* entrypoint.
    - `/dist/source/renderer` Bundled *renderer* entrypoint.
    - `/dist/source/preload` Bundled *preload* entrypoint.
    - `/dist/source/*` Bundled any custom files.
  - `/dist/app`
  Contain packages and ready-to-distribute electron apps for any platform. Files in this directory created using [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/).
- `/config`
  Contains various configuration files for Vite, TypeScript, electron builder, etc.
- `/bin`
  It is believed any scripts for build the application will be located here.
- `/types` 
  Contains all declaration files to be applied globally to the entire project
- `/test`
  Contains all tests
