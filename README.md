# Vite Electron Builder Template

> Vite+Electron = 🔥

This is a secure template for electron applications. Written following the latest safety requirements, recommendations and best practices.

Under the hood is used [Vite 2.0](https://vitejs.dev/) -- super fast, nextgen bundler, and [Electron builder](https://www.electron.build/) for compilation.

By default, the **Vue framework** is used for the interface, but you can easily use any other frameworks such as **React**, **Preact**, **Angular**, **Svelte** or anything else.

> Vite is framework agnostic

## Features

### Electron
- Template use the latest electron version with all the latest security patches.
- The architecture of the application is built according to the security [guids](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security) and best practices.
- The latest version of the [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) is used to compile the application.
### Vite 2.0
- [Vite 2.0 BETA](https://vitejs.dev/) is used to package all source codes. This is an extremely fast packer that has a bunch of great features. You can learn more about how it is arranged in [this](https://youtu.be/xXrhg26VCSc) video.
- Vite [supports](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) reading `.env` files. My template has a separate command to generate `.d.ts` file with type definition your environment variables.

Vite provides you with many useful features, such as: `TypeScript`, `TSX/JSX`, `CSS / JSON Importing`, `CSS Modules`, `Web Assembly` and much more.

[See all Vite features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html).
### TypeScript
- The Latest TypeScript is used for all source code. 
- **Vite** supports TypeScript out of the box. However, it does not support type checking.
- Type checking is performed in both `.ts` and `.vue` files thanks to [@vuedx/typecheck](https://github.com/znck/vue-developer-experience/tree/master/packages/typecheck).
- Code formatting rules follow the latest TypeScript recommendations and best practices thanks to [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin).
### Vue 3
- By default, web pages are built using the latest version of the [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next). However, there are no problems with using any other frameworks or technologies.
- ~~The latest version of the [Vue router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next) is also used~~. See [#6](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/pull/6).
- Code formatting rules follow the latest Vue recommendations and best practices thanks to [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue).
- Installed [Vue.js devtools beta](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg) with Vue 3 support.
### Continuous Integration
- The configured workflow for check the types for each push and PR.
- The configured workflow for check the code style for each push and PR.
- **Automatic tests** used [spectron](https://www.electronjs.org/spectron). Simple, automated test check:
  - Does the main window open
  - Is the main window not empty
  - Is dev tools closed
### Continuous deployment
- An automatic update from GitHub releases is supported.
- Each time you push changes to the main branch, a workflow starts, which creates a new github release.
  - The version number is automatically set based on the current date in the format "yy.mm.dd".
  - Notes are automatically generated and added to the new release.

## Status
- ✅ Building main and renderer endpoints in production mode -- works great.
- ✅ Development mode with hot reload for renderer endpoint -- works great.
- ⚠ Development mode for main and preload endpoints -- work fine, but it is possible to reboot the backend faster ([vite#972](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/972))
- ✅ Compile the app with electron builder in CD -- work.
- ✅ Auto update -- work.
- ✅ Typechecking in `.ts` and `.vue` files -- work thanks [@vuedx/typecheck](https://github.com/znck/vue-developer-experience/tree/master/packages/typecheck) (🚨Alpha)
- ⚠ Linting -- work fine, but need review the configuration files and refactor its.
- ✅ Vue.js devtools beta.
- ⏳ Code signing -- planned.
- ⚠ Vite 2.0 -- still in beta.

## How it works
The template required a minimum [dependencies](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/blob/main/package.json). Only **Vite** is used for building, nothing more.

### Using electron API in renderer
As per the security requirements, context isolation is enabled in this template.
> Context Isolation is a feature that ensures that both your `preload` scripts and Electron's internal logic run in a separate context to the website you load in a [`webContents`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-contents.md).  This is important for security purposes as it helps prevent the website from accessing Electron internals or the powerful APIs your preload script has access to.
>
> This means that the `window` object that your preload script has access to is actually a **different** object than the website would have access to.  For example, if you set `window.hello = 'wave'` in your preload script and context isolation is enabled `window.hello` will be undefined if the website tries to access it.

[Read more about Context Isolation](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/context-isolation.md).

Exposing APIs from your `preload script` to the renderer is a common usecase and there is a dedicated module in Electron to help you do this in a painless way.
```ts
// /src/preload/index.ts
const api = {
  data: ['foo', 'bar'],
  doThing: () => ipcRenderer.send('do-a-thing')
}

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electron', api)
```

To access this API use the `useElectron()` function:
```ts
// /src/renderer/App.vue
import {useElectron} from '/@/use/electron'

const {doThing, data} = useElectron()
```

**Note**: Context isolation disabled for `test` environment. See [#693](https://github.com/electron-userland/spectron/issues/693#issuecomment-747872160).

### Modes and Environment Variables
All environment variables set as part of the `import.meta`, so you can access them as follows: `import.meta.env`. 

You can also build type definitions of your variables by running `/bin/buildEnvTypes.js`. This command will create `/types/env.d.ts` file with describing all environment variables for all modes.

The mode option is used to specify the value of `import.meta.env.MODE` and the corresponding environment variables files that needs to be loaded.

By default, there are two modes:
  - `production` is used by default
  - `development` is used by `npm run watch` script
  - `test` is used by `npm test` script

When running building, environment variables are loaded from the following files in your project root:

```
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified env mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified env mode, ignored by git
```

**Note:** only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to your code (e.g. `VITE_SOME_KEY=123`) and `SOME_KEY=123` will not.  you can access `VITE_SOME_KEY` using `import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY`. This is because the `.env` files may be used by some users for server-side or build scripts and may contain sensitive information that should not be exposed in code shipped to browsers.

### Project Structure
- `/src`
  Contains all source code.
  - `/src/main` 
  Contain entrypoint for Electron [**main script**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file).
  - `/src/renderer` 
    Contain entrypoint for Electron [**web page**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-a-web-page). All files in this directory work as a regular Vue application.
  - `/src/preload` 
    Contain entrypoint for custom script. It uses as `preload` script in `BrowserWindow.webPreferences.preload`. See [Checklist: Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content).
  - `/src/*` It is assumed any entry points will be added here, for custom scripts, web workers, webassembly compilations, etc.
