> Vite+Electron = 🔥

This is a secure template for electron applications. Written following the latest safety requirements, recommendations and best practices.

Under the hood is used [Vite] — super fast, nextgen bundler, and [electron-builder] for compilation.

## Get started

Follow these steps to get started with this template:

1. Click the **[Use this template](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/generate)** button (you must be logged in) or just clone this repo.
2. If you want use another package manager don't forget edit [`.github/workflows`](/.github/workflows) -- it uses `npm` by default.

That's all you need. 😉

**Note**: This template uses npm v7 feature — [**Installing Peer Dependencies Automatically**](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/implemented/0025-install-peer-deps.md). If you are using a different package manager, you may need to install some peerDependencies manually.




## Features

### Electron [![Electron version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/dev/electron?label=%20)][electron]
- Template use the latest electron version with all the latest security patches.
- The architecture of the application is built according to the security [guides](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security) and best practices.
- The latest version of the [electron-builder] is used to compile the application.


### Vite [![Vite version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/dev/vite?label=%20)][vite]
- [Vite] is used to bundle all source codes. This is an extremely fast packer that has a bunch of great features. You can learn more about how it is arranged in [this](https://youtu.be/xXrhg26VCSc) video.
- Vite [supports](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) reading `.env` files. You can also specify types of your environment variables in [`types/vite-env.d.ts`](types/vite-env.d.ts).
- Hot reloads for `Main` and `Renderer` processes.

Vite provides you with many useful features, such as: `TypeScript`, `TSX/JSX`, `CSS/JSON Importing`, `CSS Modules`, `Web Assembly` and much more.

[See all Vite features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html).


### TypeScript [![TypeScript version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/dev/typescript?label=%20)][typescript] (optional)
- The Latest TypeScript is used for all source code. 
- **Vite** supports TypeScript out of the box. However, it does not support type checking.
- Code formatting rules follow the latest TypeScript recommendations and best practices thanks to [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin).

**[See this discussion](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/discussions/339)** if you want completly remove TypeScript. 


### Vue [![Vue version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/vue?label=%20)][vue] (optional)
- By default, web pages are built using [Vue]. However, you can easily change it. Or do not use additional frameworks at all. (See [React fork](https://github.com/soulsam480/vite-electron-react-starter))
- Also, by default, the [vue-router] version [![Vue-router version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/vue-router?label=%20)][vue-router] is used.
- Code formatting rules follow the latest Vue recommendations and best practices thanks to [eslint-plugin-vue].
- Installed [Vue.js devtools beta](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg) with Vue 3 support.

See [examples of web pages for different frameworks](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).

### Continuous Integration
- The configured workflow for check the types for each push and PR.
- The configured workflow for check the code style for each push and PR.
- **Automatic tests** used [playwright]. Simple, automated test check:
  - Does the main window created and visible?
  - Is the main window not empty?
  - Is dev tools closed?
  - Is preload script loaded?
  

### Continuous delivery
- Each time you push changes to the `main` branch, [`release`](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow starts, which creates release draft.
  - The version is automatically set based on the current date in the format `yy.mm.dd-minutes`.
  - Notes are automatically generated and added to the release draft.
  - Code signing supported. See [`compile` job in `release` workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).
- **Auto-update is supported**. After the release will be published, all client applications will download the new version and install updates silently.


## Status

This template was created to make my work easier. It may not be universal, but I try to keep it that way.

I am actively involved in its development. But I do not guarantee that this template will be maintained in the future.


**At the moment, there are the following problems:**

- ⚠ Playwright has [**experimental** support for Electron](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron/).
- ⚠ Release notes are created automatically based on commit history. [`.github/actions/release-notes`](.github/actions/release-notes) is used for generation. It may not provide some scenarios. If you encounter a problem - write about it.
- ⏳ I want to migrate all code base to ESM. But because Nodejs  ecosystem is unprepared I have not known whether this will give more benefits or more inconvenience.

Some improvement or problems can be listed in [issues](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/issues).

**Pull requests are welcome**.

## How it works
The template required a minimum [dependencies](package.json). Only **Vite** is used for building, nothing more.

### Project Structure

The structure of this template is very similar to the structure of a monorepo.

The entire source code of the program is divided into three modules (packages) that are bundled each independently:
- [`packages/main`](packages/main)
Electron [**main script**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file).
- [`packages/preload`](packages/preload)
Used in `BrowserWindow.webPreferences.preload`. See [Checklist: Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content).
- [`packages/renderer`](packages/renderer)
Electron [**web page**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-a-web-page).

### Build web resources

Packages `main` and `preload` are built in [library mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode) as it is a simple javascript.
`renderer` package build as regular web app.

The build of web resources is performed in the [`scripts/build.js`](scripts/build.js). Its analogue is a sequential call to `vite build` for each package.

### Compile App
Next step is run  packaging and compilation a ready for distribution Electron app for macOS, Windows and Linux with "auto update" support out of the box. 

To do this, using the [electron-builder]:
- In npm script `compile`: This script is configured to compile the application as quickly as possible. It is not ready for distribution, is compiled only for the current platform and is used for debugging.
- In GitHub Action: The application is compiled for any platform and ready-to-distribute files are automatically added to the draft GitHub release. 


### Using Node.js API in renderer
According to [Electron's security guidelines](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content), Node.js integration is disabled for remote content. This means that **you cannot call any Node.js api in the `packages/renderer` directly**. To do this, you **must** describe the interface in the `packages/preload` where Node.js api is allowed:
```ts
// packages/preload/src/index.ts
import {readFile} from 'fs/promises'

const api = {
  readConfig: () =>  readFile('/path/to/config.json', {encoding: 'utf-8'}),
}

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electron', api)
```

```ts
// packages/renderer/src/App.vue
import {useElectron} from '/@/use/electron'

const {readConfig} = useElectron()
```

[Read more about Security Considerations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation#security-considerations).


### Modes and Environment Variables
All environment variables set as part of the `import.meta`, so you can access them as follows: `import.meta.env`. 

You can also specify types of your environment variables in [`types/vite-env.d.ts`](types/vite-env.d.ts).

The mode option is used to specify the value of `import.meta.env.MODE` and the corresponding environment variables files that needs to be loaded.

By default, there are two modes:
  - `production` is used by default
  - `development` is used by `npm run watch` script

When running building, environment variables are loaded from the following files in your project root:

```
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified env mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified env mode, ignored by git
```

**Note:** only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to your code (e.g. `VITE_SOME_KEY=123`) and `SOME_KEY=123` will not. You can access `VITE_SOME_KEY` using `import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY`. This is because the `.env` files may be used by some users for server-side or build scripts and may contain sensitive information that should not be exposed in code shipped to browsers.
